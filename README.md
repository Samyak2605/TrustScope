# TRUSTSCOPE
### AI Prediction Reliability & Trust Assessment Platform

TRUSTSCOPE is a production-grade AI system designed to evaluate whether a model prediction should be trusted. It moves beyond raw accuracy by analyzing uncertainty, model disagreement, calibration, and data distribution shift to provide a comprehensive trust score.

## 💡 Why TRUSTSCOPE?
Most machine learning systems output predictions without answering a critical question: **Can this specific prediction be trusted?**

In high-stakes domains like **Finance, Healthcare, and Safety-Critical Infrastructure**, an overconfident but incorrect prediction can lead to catastrophic outcomes. TRUSTSCOPE focuses on **prediction reliability** rather than accuracy alone, surfacing hidden uncertainties and recommending human intervention when trust thresholds are not met.

## 🛠 Core Capabilities
- **SAFE / REVIEW / UNSAFE Classification**: Categorizes predictions based on risk.
- **Multi-Method Uncertainty**: Quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.
- **Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection**: Identifies inputs that significantly differ from training data.
- **Model Agreement**: Measures consistency across diverse ensemble architectures.
- **Confidence Calibration**: Assesses if predicted probabilities align with historical accuracy.
- **Natural Language Explanations**: Translates technical signals into readable trust justifications.
- **Auditability**: MLOps-style logging of every decision for governance and compliance.

## 🏗 System Overview
TRUSTSCOPE operates as a decision-support layer integrated into the ML pipeline:

1. **Input Features**: Production data is received via FastAPI.
2. **Multi-Model Inference**: Predictions are generated by an ensemble (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Network).
3. **Signal Quantification**: Uncertainty (MC Dropout), Disagreement, and Distribution Similarity (Mahalanobis) are computed.
4. **Trust Synthesis**: signals are aggregated into a conservative 0-100 Trust Score.
5. **Recommendation**: A human-in-the-loop recommendation is produced (SAFE, REVIEW, or UNSAFE).
6. **Audit Trail**: Every decision and metadata signal is stored in structured logs.

## 🧠 Trust Signals Explained

#### **Model Agreement**
Measures the variance across multiple model architectures. High disagreement indicates that the prediction is unstable and sensitive to model choice.

#### **Epistemic Uncertainty**
Estimated using **Monte Carlo Dropout** in a Neural Network. By performing multiple stochastic forward passes, we capture the model's internal uncertainty regarding its own parameters.

#### **Data Similarity (OOD Detection)**
Uses **Mahalanobis Distance** to evaluate where the input sits in the multivariate feature space of the training corpus. Inputs in 'rare' regions trigger lower trust.

#### **Calibration Quality**
Uses **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)** to assess if the model's raw probability (confidence) is misleadingly high compared to its observed reliability.

## ⚖️ Trust Decision Logic
TRUSTSCOPE prioritizes safety by being conservative in its decisions:

- **🟢 SAFE**: High confidence, low ensemble variance, and high similarity to training data.
- **🟡 REVIEW**: Moderate uncertainty or partial signal conflict. Requires manual verification.
- **🔴 UNSAFE**: High uncertainty, strong model disagreement, or OOD input. Prediction rejected.

## 📈 Engineering & MLOps Practices
- **Strict Separation of Concerns**: Modular logic for modeling, science, and API.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Deep cleaning layer for JSON serialization of mathematical types.
- **Audit Logging**: Structured JSONL logs for every trust assessment.
- **Reproducibility**: Automated data setup and environment management.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **Decision Support Only**: Designed to assist human experts, not replace them.
- **Model Dependency**: Trust signals are only as diverse as the underlying models.
- **Offline Drift**: Current version detects OOD at inference but does not track long-term drift windows.
